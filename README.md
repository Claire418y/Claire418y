ðŸŒ± I'm a student with a passion for becoming a UX designer. Currently majoring in Graphic Information Technology (User Experience) at Arizona State University, my goal after graduation is to focus on designing exceptional products and services that enhance user experiences. 

While I consider coding to be a fundamental skill, I'm putting effort into learning and mastering it to complement my design skills. My aim is to create user-centered designs that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.
